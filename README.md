# CL-TeamProfileGenerator

## Description
This app will allow users to input information about their employee's/team's and have it automatically generate a formatted/styled html page to display their teams profile. 

## Installation/Usage Instructions
please follow the steps below to install the command-line Team Profile Generator and use it

INSTALLATION
1. clone this project repository onto your computer (Link to repo: https://github.com/alexh3422/CL-TeamProfileGenerator ) 
2. In the terminal application of your choice, navigate to the root folder of this project
3. run the command ' npm i ' to install the necessary modules to run the app 

USAGE
1. in your terminal app from the root folder of the application run the command ' node index.js ' - this will start up the application in the same terminal window. 
2. follow the on screen prompts to build your team by entering the information that the application asks for. Once you hit ENTER after answering a question, it will move on to the next one. 
3. to keep adding team members press the ' Y ' key on your keyboard when it asks if you would like to add another employee (you do not need to hit enter after selecting Y or N for this question.)
4. When you are done adding team members, you can press the ' N ' key on your keyboard when it asks if you would like to add another employee (once again you do not need to hit enter after selecting Y or N for this question.)

As soon as you press the ' N ' key when it asks if you would like to add another employee you should see a message letting you know that it is creating your teams profile page. 

When it is done you will see another message stating that it has been built. 

You can locate the html file that was generated in a folder called ' dist ' that you will see in the root folder of this application that was cloned to your computer.

You can then take that html file and move it into your own project repository on your local machine or do whatever else with the html file that you would like. 

(Please note that each time you generate a new html file with this app, the old one will be replaced. We are working on adding updates so that you can generate new html pages without it replacing the old one as well as features that will let you view in the app your previously created team list/information and add to it or edit the current information)
